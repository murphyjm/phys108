Repo with Physics 108 project data and analysis

- All of the analysis is done in data_reduction_testing.ipynb. 
- The custom DataSheet object is in data_reduction.py. 
- The Excel spreadsheets in the home directory are the ones read by data_reduction.py so they need to be in the same directory or adjust the path accordingly in the .py file.
